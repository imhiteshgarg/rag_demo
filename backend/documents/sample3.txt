Python Programming and Data Science

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It has become the de facto language for data science, machine learning, and AI development.

Key Python libraries for data science:
- NumPy: Numerical computing and array operations
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib: Data visualization
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms
- TensorFlow/PyTorch: Deep learning frameworks

Python's ecosystem includes powerful tools for working with text and documents:
- LangChain: Framework for building applications with LLMs
- Sentence Transformers: Generating embeddings from text
- ChromaDB: Vector database for storing embeddings
- Beautiful Soup: Web scraping and HTML parsing

Best practices in Python development:
- Use virtual environments to manage dependencies
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Write docstrings for functions and classes
- Use type hints for better code clarity
- Implement error handling with try-except blocks

Python's versatility makes it ideal for building end-to-end data science pipelines, from data collection and preprocessing to model training and deployment.
