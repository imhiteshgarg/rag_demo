Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG, is a technique that combines information retrieval with generative AI models. RAG systems enhance the capabilities of language models by providing them with relevant context from external knowledge sources.

The RAG process typically involves:
1. Document ingestion: Loading and processing documents into a searchable format
2. Embedding generation: Converting text into vector representations
3. Vector storage: Storing embeddings in a vector database
4. Retrieval: Finding relevant documents based on query similarity
5. Generation: Using retrieved context to generate accurate responses

RAG addresses several limitations of traditional language models:
- Reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in actual documents
- Allows access to up-to-date information without retraining
- Enables domain-specific knowledge integration
- Provides traceability through source citations

Vector databases like ChromaDB, Pinecone, and Weaviate are commonly used in RAG systems to efficiently store and search through embeddings. The quality of embeddings, typically generated using models like Sentence Transformers, directly impacts retrieval accuracy.
