Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Key concepts in machine learning include:
- Supervised learning: Training models on labeled data
- Unsupervised learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- Reinforcement learning: Learning through interaction with an environment

Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns. Neural networks are inspired by the structure of the human brain and consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information.

Common applications of AI and ML include:
- Natural language processing
- Computer vision
- Recommendation systems
- Autonomous vehicles
- Medical diagnosis
